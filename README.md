# Simple webapp structure

##### First install bower and npm dependencies:

```
$ npm  install
```

```
$ bower install
```

##### Running local:

```
$ gulp serve
```

Works in ```:7000``` port, but you can change this in ```gulpfile.js```

> **Note:**

> - This structure uses Sass.
> - Bootstrap is implanted.
